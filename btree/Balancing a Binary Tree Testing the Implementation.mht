  <P>Now that all the easy work is done we get to the hard part: writing =
a test=20
  driver to verify that it was done right. Whatever we do, our test =
driver is=20
  going to get complicated. So I propose that we keep it simple wherever =
we can;=20
  in particular, I suggest, for the purposes of this discussion, that we =
write=20
  several discreet drivers instead of rolling all our tests into a =
single=20
  program, and that we don't try too hard to fully automate the process; =
instead=20
  we can display results at various points, and eyeball the display to =
make sure=20
  that the results are valid. We'll leave it as an exercise to the =
reader to=20
  bolt our test drivers together and massage them into a single process =
that can=20
  be fully automated.=20
  <P>Our first question, of course, is just what do we need to test? Our =
biggest=20
  changes to the BTREE module were adding the <B><I>delete, =
recycle</I></B> and=20
  <B><I>validate methods,</I></B> the <B><I>statistics facility</I></B> =
and, of=20
  course, the <B><I>balance method.</I></B> We also had to modify the =
various=20
  the <B><I>add</I></B> utilities to utilize the new recycling logic. =
Testing in=20
  each of these areas is described below. In addition, we probably =
shouldn't=20
  miss the opportunity to see how fast (or slow) our implementation is, =
so we'll=20
  build some timing analysis into the test drivers, as well.=20
